<h1>My Cause</h1>
<h2>Gender Equality</h2>
<br>
<p>Gender Equality is important to me. As a woman, there are a lot of challenges we face to reach the same level as men in our society. 
There are a lot of privileges men take for granted. This cause is important to me because I want to have the same opportunities as everyone
else and also don't want assumptions to be made solely because of my gender. Key social and economic issues include safety, 
the wage gap, equal access to education, and equal representation in media.</p>

<p>The link listed above is a link to a dataset of the number of women in STEM majors vs men. This data is important to my cause because
there is a stigma in our society that women are not as capable in all STEM fields as men. While the number of women in STEM is on the rise, 
there are still many societal problems involving access to education and the pre-existing stigma.</p>
